"""§wyrlz Server 2.1.17 release entrypoint.

2.1.17 makes the dev hot-runtime plane self-hydrating on active requests. Chat
HTML/CSS/JS and the R39 hot engine are delta-refreshed from the durable dev
branch into ephemeral /tmp runtime storage without requiring a manual Hot Sync
button press after every change or cold instance. Bundled assets remain the
fail-safe fallback, and explicit clear/rollback suspends auto refresh.
