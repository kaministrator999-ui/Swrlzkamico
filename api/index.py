"""§wyrlz Server 2.1.18 release entrypoint.

2.1.18 introduces the compiled R39 native quantized-matvec backend while retaining
Python reference inference as the correctness/fallback oracle. Native kernels operate
on SWRLZX quantized weights directly instead of materializing float matrices per token.
Server-managed Chat authorization, hot runtime, and live page delivery remain intact.
